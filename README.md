The idea of the project is to provide a user with acommend line tool to analyse bikeshare data from the data files on the three cities provided in the project. This will allow a user to gain insights about the bieshare data such as user statistics, time travelled, station statistics, etc.

### Files used
The following files contain the bikeshare data:
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv
* washington.csv

THe folloing file is the only script file included:
* bikeshare.py

### UX
The user experience should be a simple as possible as many people encountering the command line for the first time find it intimidating to navigate. This application accounts for this issue by leading the user through the script with simple yes or no responses required.
